# automaton-v30

This project is a Cypress testing framework designed to run end-to-end tests for web applications. Users can define and execute automated tests to ensure the quality and functionality of their web projects.

## Project Structure

*   `cypress/`: This directory contains all the Cypress test-related files.
    *   `e2e/`: Holds the end-to-end test specifications (e.g., `spec.cy.js`). These files contain the actual test scripts that simulate user interactions with the application.
    *   `support/`: Contains reusable custom commands and global configurations that can be used across different test files. `commands.js` is a common place to define custom Cypress commands, and `e2e.js` is run before every spec file.
*   `.github/workflows/`: This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow configurations.
    *   `cypress-test.yml`: Defines a workflow that automatically runs the Cypress tests, likely on every push or pull request to the repository. This helps in continuous integration by ensuring tests pass before code changes are merged.
*   `cypress.config.js`: This is the main configuration file for Cypress. It allows you to customize various aspects of the Cypress test runner, such as base URL, viewport size, and environment variables.
*   `package.json`: Defines the project's metadata, including dependencies (like Cypress), and scripts for managing and running the project (e.g., `npm install`, test scripts).
*   `package-lock.json`: Records the exact versions of dependencies used in the project, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd automaton-v30
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command in the project root to install the necessary dependencies defined in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Cypress tests:**
    You can run the Cypress tests using the following command. This will typically open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to see the tests execute in a browser.
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```
    To run the tests in headless mode (e.g., in a CI environment), use:
    ```bash
    npx cypress run
    ```
